**Pull Request Pre-Flight Checklist**
- [ ] Did you add new unit tests for all applicable source code?
- [ ] Did you run through a basic set of functional tests to prove out these changes?
- [ ] If this is a "release" (aka a PR into the ```main``` branch), did you increment/set the version in ```version.h``` accordingly?

**What issues does this close? (The keyword ```closes``` followed by a #ISSUE_NUMBER will automatically close the issue when this PR is completed. i.e ```closes #10```)**
